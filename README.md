# G-Meet-Clone
This project is a gmeet clone where we can organise a meeting on a particular date and time and the application will notify you by sending email on the account by which you have logged in, to join the meet. In the meeting the users will be able to chat and work on a common white board.  PeerJs will be used for connecting to different IDs. WebRTC will be used to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media.
